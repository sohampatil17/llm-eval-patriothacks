The standard description is modified to suit \nprogram/project-specific needs, and appropriate language is included in SOWs to implement actions \nresulting from the data evaluation. “Data suppliers” may be contractors, academia, or the Government. \nProcurement of data from an outside supplier is a formal procurement action that requires a \nprocurement document; in-house requirements may be handled using a less formal method. Below are \nthe different types of data that might be utilized within a program/project: \n• Data \n»» “Data” is defined in general as “recorded information regardless of the form or method of \nrecording.” However, the terms “data” and “information” are frequently used interchangeably. To be \nmore precise, data generally should be processed in some manner to generate useful, actionable \ninformation. \n»» “Data,” as used in SE DM, includes technical data; computer software documentation; and \nrepresentation of facts, numbers, or data of any nature that can be communicated, stored, and \nprocessed to form information required by a contract or agreement to be delivered to, or accessed by, \nthe Government. \n»» Data include that associated with system development, modeling and simulation used in \ndevelopment or test, test and evaluation, installation, parts, spares, repairs, usage data required for \nproduct sustainability, and source and/or supplier data. \n»» Data specifically not included in Technical Data Management would be data relating to general NASA \nworkforce operations information, communications information (except where related to a specific \nrequirement), financial transactions, personnel data, transactional data, and other data of a purely \nbusiness nature. \n• Data Call: Solicitation from Government stakeholders (specifically Integrated Product Team (IPT) leads \nand functional managers) identifies and justifies their data requirements from a proposed contracted \nprocurement. Since data provided by contractors have a cost to the Government, a data call (or an \nequivalent activity) is a common control mechanism used to ensure that the requested data are truly \nneeded. If approved by the data call, a description of each data item needed is then developed and \nplaced on contract. \n• Information: Information is generally considered as processed data. The form of the processed data is \ndependent on the documentation, report, review formats, or templates that are applicable. \n• Technical Data Package: A technical data package is a technical description of an item adequate for \nsupporting an acquisition strategy, production, engineering, and logistics support. The package defines \nthe required design configuration and procedures to ensure adequacy of item performance. It consists \nof all applicable items such as drawings, associated lists, specifications, standards, performance \nrequirements, quality assurance provisions, and packaging details. \n• Technical Data Management System: The strategies, plans, procedures, tools, people, data formats, \ndata exchange rules, databases, and other entities and descriptions required to manage the technical \ndata of a program/project. \n6.6.1.2.2 Collect and Store Data \nSubsequent activities collect, store, and maintain technical data and provide it to authorized parties as \nrequired. Some considerations that impact these activities for implementing Technical Data \nManagement include: \n• Requirements relating to the flow/delivery of data to or from a contractor should be specified in the \ntechnical data management plan and included in the Request for Proposal (RFP) and contractor \nagreement. \n• NASA should not impose changes on existing contractor data management systems unless the \nprogram/project technical data management requirements, including data exchange requirements, \ncannot otherwise be met. \n• Responsibility for data inputs into the technical data management system lies solely with the \noriginator or generator of the data. \n• The availability/access of technical data lies with the author, originator, or generator of the data in \nconjunction with the manager of the technical data management system. \n• The established availability/access description and list should be baselined and placed under \nconfiguration control. \n• For new programs/projects, a digital generation and delivery medium is desired. Existing programs/ \nprojects should weigh the cost/benefit trades of digitizing hard copy data. \nTABLE 6.6-1 defines the tasks required to capture technical data. \n6.6.1.2.3 Provide Data to Authorized Parties \nAll data deliverables should include distribution statements and procedures to protect all data that \ncontain critical technology information, as well as to ensure that limited distribution data, intellectual \nproperty data, or proprietary data are properly handled during systems engineering activities. This \ninjunction applies whether the data are hard copy or digital. \nAs part of overall asset protection planning, NASA has established special procedures for the protection \nof Critical Program Information (CPI). CPI may include components; engineering, design, or \nmanufacturing processes; technologies; system capabilities, and vulnerabilities; and any other \ninformation that gives a system its distinctive operational capability. \nCPI protection should be a key consideration for the technical data management effort and is part of the \nasset protection planning process. \n6.6.1.3 Outputs \nOutputs include timely, secure availability of needed data in various representations to those authorized \nto receive it. Major outputs from the Technical Data Management Process include the following (see \nFIGURE 6.6-1): \n• Form of Technical Data Products: How each type of data is held and stored such as textual, graphic, \nvideo, etc. \n• Technical Data Electronic Exchange Formats: Description and perhaps templates, models or other \nways to capture the formats used for the various data exchanges. \n• Delivered Technical Data: The data that were delivered to the requester. \nOther work products generated as part of this process include the strategy and procedures used for \ntechnical data management, request dispositions, decisions, and assumptions. \n6.6.2 Technical Data Management Guidance \nRefer to Section 6.6.2 in the NASA Expanded Guidance for Systems Engineering at \nhttps://nen.nasa.gov/web/se/doc-repository for additional guidance on: \n• data security and \n• ITAR. \n6.7 Technical Assessment \nTechnical assessment is the crosscutting process used to help monitor technical progress of a \nprogram/project through periodic technical reviews and through monitoring of technical indicators such \nas MOEs, MOPs, Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), and TPMs. The reviews and metrics also provide \nstatus information to support assessing system design, product realization, and technical management \ndecisions. \n",

              "text": "4.4.1.2.5 Increase the Resolution of the Design \nThe successive refinement process of FIGURE 4.4-2 illustrates a continuing refinement of the system \ndesign. At each level of decomposition, the baselined derived (and allocated) requirements become the \nset of high-level requirements for the decomposed elements, and the process begins again. One might \nask, “When do we stop refining the design?” The answer is that the design effort proceeds to a depth \nthat is sufficient to meet several needs: the design should penetrate sufficiently to allow analytical \nvalidation of the design to the requirements and ConOps; it should also have sufficient depth to support \ncost and operations modeling and to convince a review team of a feasible design with performance, \ncost, and risk margins. \nThe systems engineering engine is applied again and again as the system is developed. As the system is \nrealized, the issues addressed evolve and the particulars of the activity change. Most of the major \nsystem decisions (goals, architecture, acceptable life cycle cost, etc.) are made during the early phases \nof the project, so the successive refinements do not correspond precisely to the phases of the system \nlife cycle. Much of the system architecture can be seen even at the outset, so the successive \nrefinements do not correspond exactly to development of the architectural hierarchy either. Rather, \nthey correspond to the successively greater resolution by which the system is defined. \nIt is reasonable to expect the system to be defined with better resolution as time passes. This tendency \nis formalized at some point (in Phase B) by defining a baseline system definition. Usually, the goals, \nobjectives, and constraints are baselined as the requirements portion of the baseline. The entire \nbaseline is then placed under configuration control in an attempt to ensure that any subsequent \nchanges are indeed justified and affordable. \nAt this point in the systems engineering process, there is a logical branch point. For those issues for \nwhich the process of successive refinement has proceeded far enough, the next step is to implement the \ndecisions at that level of resolution. For those issues that are still insufficiently resolved, the next step is \nto refine the development further. \n4.4.1.2.6 Fully Describe the Design Solution \nOnce the preferred design alternative has been selected and the proper level of refinement has been \ncompleted, then the design is fully defined into a final design solution that will satisfy the technical \nrequirements and ConOps. The design solution definition will be used to generate the end product \nspecifications that will be used to produce the product and to conduct product verification. This process \nmay be further refined depending on whether there are additional subsystems of the end product that \nneed to be defined. \nThe scope and content of the full design description should be appropriate for the product life cycle \nphase, the phase success criteria, and the product position in the PBS (system structure). Depending on \nthese factors, the form of the design solution definition could be simply a simulation model or a paper \nstudy report. The technical data package evolves from phase to phase, starting with conceptual sketches \nor models and ending with complete drawings, parts list, and other details needed for product \nimplementation or product integration. Typical output definitions from the Design Solution Definition \nProcess are shown in FIGURE 4.4-1 and are described in Section 4.4.1.3. \n4.4.1.2.7 Verify the Design Solution \nOnce an acceptable design solution has been selected from among the various alternative designs and \ndocumented in a technical data package, the design solution should next be verified against the system \nrequirements and constraints. A method to achieve this verification is by means of a peer review to \nevaluate the resulting design solution definition. Guidelines for conducting a peer review are discussed \nin Section 6.7.2.4.5. \nIn addition, peer reviews play a significant role as a detailed technical component of higher level \ntechnical and programmatic reviews. For example, the peer review of a component battery design can \ngo into much more technical detail on the battery than the integrated power subsystem review. Peer \nreviews can cover the components of a subsystem down to the level appropriate for verifying the design \nagainst the requirements. Concerns raised at the peer review might have implications on the power \nsubsystem design and verification and therefore should be reported at the next higher level review of \nthe power subsystem. \nThe verification should show that the design solution definition: \n• Is realizable within the constraints imposed on the technical effort; \n• Has specified requirements that are stated in acceptable statements and have bidirectional traceability \nwith the technical requirements and stakeholder expectations; and \n• Has decisions and assumptions made in forming the solution consistent with its set of technical \nrequirements and identified system product and service constraints. \nThis design solution verification is in contrast to the verification of the end product described in the end \nproduct verification plan which is part of the technical data package. That verification occurs in a later \nlife cycle phase and is a result of the Product Verification Process (see Section 5.3) applied to the \nrealization of the design solution as an end product. \n4.4.1.2.8 Validate the Design Solution \nThe validation of the design solution is a recursive and iterative process as shown in FIGURE 4.0-1. Each \nalternative design concept is validated against the set of stakeholder expectations. The stakeholder \nexpectations drive the iterative design loop in which a straw man architecture/design, the ConOps, and \nthe derived requirements are developed. These three products should be consistent with each other \nand will require iterations and design decisions to achieve this consistency. Once consistency is \nachieved, functional analyses allow the study team to validate the design against the stakeholder \nexpectations. A simplified validation asks the questions: Does the system work as expected? How does \nthe system respond to failures, faults, and anomalies? Is the system affordable? If the answer to any of \nthese questions is no, then changes to the design or stakeholder expectations will be required, and the \nprocess is started over again. This process continues until the system— architecture, ConOps, and \nrequirements—meets the stakeholder expectations. \nThis design solution validation is in contrast to the validation of the end product described in the end-\nproduct validation plan, which is part of the technical data package. That validation occurs in a later life \ncycle phase and is a result of the Product Validation Process (see Section 5.4) applied to the realization \nof the design solution as an end product. \n4.4.1.2.9 Identify Enabling Products \nEnabling products are the life cycle support products and services (e.g., production, test, deployment, \ntraining, maintenance, and disposal) that facilitate the progression and use of the operational end \nproduct through its life cycle. Since the end product and its enabling products are interdependent, they \nare viewed as a system. Project responsibility thus extends to responsibility for acquiring services from \nthe relevant enabling products in each life cycle phase. When a suitable enabling product does not \nalready exist, the project that is responsible for the end product can also be responsible for creating and \nusing the enabling product. \nTherefore, an important activity in the Design Solution Definition Process is the identification of the \nenabling products and personnel that will be required during the life cycle of the selected design \nsolution and then initiating the acquisition or development of those enabling products and personnel. \nNeed dates for the enabling products should be realistically identified on the project schedules, \nincorporating appropriate schedule slack. Then firm commitments in the form of contracts, agreements, \nand/or operational plans should be put in place to ensure that the enabling products will be available \nwhen needed to support the product life cycle phase activities. The enabling product requirements are \ndocumented as part of the technical data package for the Design Solution Definition Process.  \nAn environmental test chamber is an example of an enabling product whose use would be acquired at \nan appropriate time during the test phase of a space flight system. \nSpecial test fixtures or special mechanical handling devices are examples of enabling products that \nwould have to be created by the project. Because of long development times as well as oversubscribed \nfacilities, it is important to identify enabling products and secure the commitments for them as early in \nthe design phase as possible. \n4.4.1.2.10 Baseline the Design Solution \nAs shown earlier in FIGURE 4.0-1, once the selected system design solution meets the stakeholder \nexpectations, the study team baselines the products and prepares for the next life cycle phase. Because \nof the recursive nature of successive refinement, intermediate levels of decomposition are often \nvalidated and baselined as part of the process. In the next level of decomposition, the baselined \nrequirements become the set of high-level requirements for the decomposed elements, and the process \nbegins again.  \nBaselining a particular design solution enables the technical team to focus on one design out of all the \nalternative design concepts. This is a critical point in the design process. It puts a stake in the ground and \ngets everyone on the design team focused on the same concept. When dealing with complex systems, it \nis difficult for team members to design their portion of the system if the system design is a moving \ntarget. The baselined design is documented and placed under configuration control. This includes the \nsystem requirements, specifications, and configuration descriptions. \nWhile baselining a design is beneficial to the design process, there is a danger if it is exercised too early \nin the Design Solution Definition Process. The early exploration of alternative designs should be free and \nopen to a wide range of ideas, concepts, and implementations. Baselining too early takes the inventive \nnature out of the concept exploration. Therefore, baselining should be one of the last steps in the \nDesign Solution Definition Process. \n4.4.1.3 Outputs \nOutputs of the Design Solution Definition Process are the specifications and plans that are passed on to \nthe product realization processes. They contain the design-to, build-to, train-to, and code-to \ndocumentation that complies with the approved baseline for the system. \nAs mentioned earlier, the scope and content of the full design description should be appropriate for the \nproduct life cycle phase, the phase success criteria, and the product position in the PBS. \nOutputs of the Design Solution Definition Process include the following: \n• The System Specification: The system specification contains the functional baseline for the system that \nis the result of the Design Solution Definition Process. The system design specification provides sufficient \nguidance, constraints, and system requirements for the design engineers to begin developing the design. \n• The System External Interface Specifications: The system external interface specifications describe the \nfunctional baseline for the behavior and characteristics of all physical interfaces that the system has with \nthe external world. These include all structural, thermal, electrical, and signal interfaces, as well as the \nhuman-system interfaces. \n• The End-Product Specifications: The end-product specifications contain the detailed build-to and code-\nto requirements for the end product. They are detailed, exact statements of design particulars, such as \nstatements prescribing materials, dimensions, and quality of work to build, install, or manufacture the \nend product. \n• The End-Product Interface Specifications: The end-product interface specifications contain the detailed \nbuild-to and code-to requirements for the behavior and characteristics of all logical and physical \ninterfaces that the end product has with external elements, including the human-system interfaces. \n• Initial Subsystem Specifications: The end-product subsystem initial specifications provide detailed \ninformation on subsystems if they are required. \n• Enabling Product Requirements: The requirements for associated supporting enabling products \nprovide details of all enabling products. Enabling products are the life cycle support products, \ninfrastructures, personnel, logistics, and services that facilitate the progression and use of the \noperational end product through its life cycle. They are viewed as part of the system since the end \nproduct and its enabling products are interdependent. \n• Product Verification Plan: The end-product verification plan (generated through the Technical Planning \nProcess) provides the content and depth of detail necessary to provide full visibility of all verification \nactivities for the end product. Depending on the scope of the end product, the plan encompasses \nqualification, acceptance, prelaunch, operational, and disposal verification activities for flight hardware \nand software. \n• Product Validation Plan: The end-product validation plan (generated through the Technical Planning \nProcess) provides the content and depth of detail necessary to provide full visibility of all activities to \nvalidate the end product against the baselined stakeholder expectations. The plan identifies the type of \nvalidation, the validation procedures, and the validation environment that are appropriate to confirm \nthat the realized end product conforms to stakeholder expectations. \n• Logistics and Operate-to Procedures: The applicable logistics and operate-to procedures for the \nsystem describe such things as handling, transportation, maintenance, long-term storage, and \noperational considerations for the particular design solution. \nOther outputs may include: \n• Human Systems Integration Plan: The system HSI Plan should be updated to indicate the numbers, \nskills, and development (i.e., training) required for humans throughout the full life cycle deployment and \noperations of the system.  \n4.4.2 Design Solution Definition Guidance \nRefer to Section 4.4.2 in the NASA Expanded Guidance for Systems Engineering at \nhttps://nen.nasa.gov/web/se/doc-repository for additional guidance on: \n• technology assessment, \n• human capability assessment, and \n• integrating engineering specialties into the SE process. \n",

The technical team needs to review these specifications and ensure they are in a \nform adequate for the contract or purchase order. This may include the generation of contracts, \nStatements of Work (SOWs), requests for proposals, purchase orders, or other purchasing mechanisms. \nFor major end products purchased from a vendor, the responsibilities of the Government and contractor \nteam should be documented in the SEMP and Integration Plan. This will define, for example, whether \nNASA expects the vendor to provide a fully verified and validated product or whether the NASA \ntechnical team will be performing those duties. The team needs to work with the acquisition team to \nensure the accuracy of the contract SOW or purchase order and to ensure that adequate \ndocumentation, certificates of compliance, or other specific needs are requested from the vendor. \nFor contracted purchases, as proposals come back from the vendors, the technical team should work \nwith the contracting officer and participate in the review of the technical information and in the \nselection of the vendor that best meets the design requirements for acceptable cost and schedule. \nAs the purchased products arrive, the technical team should assist in the inspection of the delivered \nproduct and its accompanying documentation. The team should ensure that the requested product was \nindeed the one delivered, and that all necessary documentation, such as source code, operator manuals, \ncertificates of compliance, safety information, or drawings have been received. \nThe NASA technical team should also ensure that any enabling products necessary to provide test, \noperations, maintenance, and disposal support for the product are also ready or provided as defined in \nthe contract. \nDepending on the strategy and roles/responsibilities of the vendor, a determination/analysis of the \nvendor’s verification and validation compliance may need to be reviewed. This may be done informally \nor formally as appropriate for the complexity of the product. For products that were verified and \nvalidated by the vendor, after ensuring that all work products from this phase have been captured, the \nproduct may be ready to enter the Product Transition Process to be delivered to the next higher level or \nto its final end user. For products that the technical team will verify and validate, the product will be \nready for verification after ensuring that all work products for this phase have been captured. \nMake/Code the Product \nIf the strategy is to make or code the product, the technical team should first ensure that the enabling \nproducts are ready. This may include ensuring all piece parts are available, drawings are complete and \nadequate, software design is complete and reviewed, machines to cut the material are available, \ninterface specifications are approved, operators are trained and available, manufacturing and/or coding \nprocedures/ processes are ready, software personnel are trained and available to generate code, test \nfixtures are developed and ready to hold products while being generated, and software test cases are \navailable and ready to begin model generation. \nThe product is then made or coded in accordance with the specified requirements, configuration \ndocumentation, and applicable standards. Software development must be consistent with NPR 7150.2, \nNASA Software Engineering Requirements. Throughout this process, the technical team should work \nwith the quality organization to review, inspect, and discuss progress and status within the team and \nwith higher levels of management as appropriate.

              "text": "Center and Agency directives sometimes specify content of documents and are \nappropriately used for in-house data preparation. The standard description is modified to suit \nprogram/project-specific needs, and appropriate language is included in SOWs to implement actions \nresulting from the data evaluation. “Data suppliers” may be contractors, academia, or the Government. \nProcurement of data from an outside supplier is a formal procurement action that requires a \nprocurement document; in-house requirements may be handled using a less formal method. Below are \nthe different types of data that might be utilized within a program/project: \n• Data \n»» “Data” is defined in general as “recorded information regardless of the form or method of \nrecording.” However, the terms “data” and “information” are frequently used interchangeably. To be \nmore precise, data generally should be processed in some manner to generate useful, actionable \ninformation. \n»» “Data,” as used in SE DM, includes technical data; computer software documentation; and \nrepresentation of facts, numbers, or data of any nature that can be communicated, stored, and \nprocessed to form information required by a contract or agreement to be delivered to, or accessed by, \nthe Government. \n»» Data include that associated with system development, modeling and simulation used in \ndevelopment or test, test and evaluation, installation, parts, spares, repairs, usage data required for \nproduct sustainability, and source and/or supplier data. \n»» Data specifically not included in Technical Data Management would be data relating to general NASA \nworkforce operations information, communications information (except where related to a specific \nrequirement), financial transactions, personnel data, transactional data, and other data of a purely \nbusiness nature. \n• Data Call: Solicitation from Government stakeholders (specifically Integrated Product Team (IPT) leads \nand functional managers) identifies and justifies their data requirements from a proposed contracted \nprocurement. Since data provided by contractors have a cost to the Government, a data call (or an \nequivalent activity) is a common control mechanism used to ensure that the requested data are truly \nneeded. If approved by the data call, a description of each data item needed is then developed and \nplaced on contract. \n• Information: Information is generally considered as processed data. The form of the processed data is \ndependent on the documentation, report, review formats, or templates that are applicable. \n• Technical Data Package: A technical data package is a technical description of an item adequate for \nsupporting an acquisition strategy, production, engineering, and logistics support. The package defines \nthe required design configuration and procedures to ensure adequacy of item performance. It consists \nof all applicable items such as drawings, associated lists, specifications, standards, performance \nrequirements, quality assurance provisions, and packaging details. \n• Technical Data Management System: The strategies, plans, procedures, tools, people, data formats, \ndata exchange rules, databases, and other entities and descriptions required to manage the technical \ndata of a program/project. \n6.6.1.2.2 Collect and Store Data \nSubsequent activities collect, store, and maintain technical data and provide it to authorized parties as \nrequired. Some considerations that impact these activities for implementing Technical Data \nManagement include: \n• Requirements relating to the flow/delivery of data to or from a contractor should be specified in the \ntechnical data management plan and included in the Request for Proposal (RFP) and contractor \nagreement. \n• NASA should not impose changes on existing contractor data management systems unless the \nprogram/project technical data management requirements, including data exchange requirements, \ncannot otherwise be met. \n• Responsibility for data inputs into the technical data management system lies solely with the \noriginator or generator of the data. \n• The availability/access of technical data lies with the author, originator, or generator of the data in \nconjunction with the manager of the technical data management system. \n• The established availability/access description and list should be baselined and placed under \nconfiguration control. \n• For new programs/projects, a digital generation and delivery medium is desired. Existing programs/ \nprojects should weigh the cost/benefit trades of digitizing hard copy data. \nTABLE 6.6-1 defines the tasks required to capture technical data. \n6.6.1.2.3 Provide Data to Authorized Parties \nAll data deliverables should include distribution statements and procedures to protect all data that \ncontain critical technology information, as well as to ensure that limited distribution data, intellectual \nproperty data, or proprietary data are properly handled during systems engineering activities. This \ninjunction applies whether the data are hard copy or digital. \nAs part of overall asset protection planning, NASA has established special procedures for the protection \nof Critical Program Information (CPI). CPI may include components; engineering, design, or \nmanufacturing processes; technologies; system capabilities, and vulnerabilities; and any other \ninformation that gives a system its distinctive operational capability. \nCPI protection should be a key consideration for the technical data management effort and is part of the \nasset protection planning process. \n6.6.1.3 Outputs \nOutputs include timely, secure availability of needed data in various representations to those authorized \nto receive it. Major outputs from the Technical Data Management Process include the following (see \nFIGURE 6.6-1): \n• Form of Technical Data Products: How each type of data is held and stored such as textual, graphic, \nvideo, etc. \n• Technical Data Electronic Exchange Formats: Description and perhaps templates, models or other \nways to capture the formats used for the various data exchanges. \n• Delivered Technical Data: The data that were delivered to the requester. \nOther work products generated as part of this process include the strategy and procedures used for \ntechnical data management, request dispositions, decisions, and assumptions. \n6.6.2 Technical Data Management Guidance \nRefer to Section 6.6.2 in the NASA Expanded Guidance for Systems Engineering at \nhttps://nen.nasa.gov/web/se/doc-repository for additional guidance on: \n• data security and \n• ITAR. \n6.7 Technical Assessment \nTechnical assessment is the crosscutting process used to help monitor technical progress of a \nprogram/project through periodic technical reviews and through monitoring of technical indicators such \nas MOEs, MOPs, Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), and TPMs. The reviews and metrics also provide \nstatus information to support assessing system design, product realization, and technical management \ndecisions. \n",

              "text": "Center and Agency directives sometimes specify content of documents and are \nappropriately used for in-house data preparation. The standard description is modified to suit \nprogram/project-specific needs, and appropriate language is included in SOWs to implement actions \nresulting from the data evaluation. “Data suppliers” may be contractors, academia, or the Government. \nProcurement of data from an outside supplier is a formal procurement action that requires a \nprocurement document; in-house requirements may be handled using a less formal method. Below are \nthe different types of data that might be utilized within a program/project: \n• Data \n»» “Data” is defined in general as “recorded information regardless of the form or method of \nrecording.” However, the terms “data” and “information” are frequently used interchangeably. To be \nmore precise, data generally should be processed in some manner to generate useful, actionable \ninformation. \n»» “Data,” as used in SE DM, includes technical data; computer software documentation; and \nrepresentation of facts, numbers, or data of any nature that can be communicated, stored, and \nprocessed to form information required by a contract or agreement to be delivered to, or accessed by, \nthe Government. \n»» Data include that associated with system development, modeling and simulation used in \ndevelopment or test, test and evaluation, installation, parts, spares, repairs, usage data required for \nproduct sustainability, and source and/or supplier data. \n»» Data specifically not included in Technical Data Management would be data relating to general NASA \nworkforce operations information, communications information (except where related to a specific \nrequirement), financial transactions, personnel data, transactional data, and other data of a purely \nbusiness nature. \n• Data Call: Solicitation from Government stakeholders (specifically Integrated Product Team (IPT) leads \nand functional managers) identifies and justifies their data requirements from a proposed contracted \nprocurement. Since data provided by contractors have a cost to the Government, a data call (or an \nequivalent activity) is a common control mechanism used to ensure that the requested data are truly \nneeded. If approved by the data call, a description of each data item needed is then developed and \nplaced on contract. \n• Information: Information is generally considered as processed data. The form of the processed data is \ndependent on the documentation, report, review formats, or templates that are applicable. \n• Technical Data Package: A technical data package is a technical description of an item adequate for \nsupporting an acquisition strategy, production, engineering, and logistics support. The package defines \nthe required design configuration and procedures to ensure adequacy of item performance. It consists \nof all applicable items such as drawings, associated lists, specifications, standards, performance \nrequirements, quality assurance provisions, and packaging details. \n• Technical Data Management System: The strategies, plans, procedures, tools, people, data formats, \ndata exchange rules, databases, and other entities and descriptions required to manage the technical \ndata of a program/project. \n6.6.1.2.2 Collect and Store Data \nSubsequent activities collect, store, and maintain technical data and provide it to authorized parties as \nrequired. Some considerations that impact these activities for implementing Technical Data \nManagement include: \n• Requirements relating to the flow/delivery of data to or from a contractor should be specified in the \ntechnical data management plan and included in the Request for Proposal (RFP) and contractor \nagreement. \n• NASA should not impose changes on existing contractor data management systems unless the \nprogram/project technical data management requirements, including data exchange requirements, \ncannot otherwise be met. \n• Responsibility for data inputs into the technical data management system lies solely with the \noriginator or generator of the data. \n• The availability/access of technical data lies with the author, originator, or generator of the data in \nconjunction with the manager of the technical data management system. \n• The established availability/access description and list should be baselined and placed under \nconfiguration control. \n• For new programs/projects, a digital generation and delivery medium is desired. Existing programs/ \nprojects should weigh the cost/benefit trades of digitizing hard copy data. \nTABLE 6.6-1 defines the tasks required to capture technical data. \n6.6.1.2.3 Provide Data to Authorized Parties \nAll data deliverables should include distribution statements and procedures to protect all data that \ncontain critical technology information, as well as to ensure that limited distribution data, intellectual \nproperty data, or proprietary data are properly handled during systems engineering activities. This \ninjunction applies whether the data are hard copy or digital. \nAs part of overall asset protection planning, NASA has established special procedures for the protection \nof Critical Program Information (CPI). CPI may include components; engineering, design, or \nmanufacturing processes; technologies; system capabilities, and vulnerabilities; and any other \ninformation that gives a system its distinctive operational capability. \nCPI protection should be a key consideration for the technical data management effort and is part of the \nasset protection planning process. \n6.6.1.3 Outputs \nOutputs include timely, secure availability of needed data in various representations to those authorized \nto receive it. Major outputs from the Technical Data Management Process include the following (see \nFIGURE 6.6-1): \n• Form of Technical Data Products: How each type of data is held and stored such as textual, graphic, \nvideo, etc. \n• Technical Data Electronic Exchange Formats: Description and perhaps templates, models or other \nways to capture the formats used for the various data exchanges. \n• Delivered Technical Data: The data that were delivered to the requester. \nOther work products generated as part of this process include the strategy and procedures used for \ntechnical data management, request dispositions, decisions, and assumptions. \n6.6.2 Technical Data Management Guidance \nRefer to Section 6.6.2 in the NASA Expanded Guidance for Systems Engineering at \nhttps://nen.nasa.gov/web/se/doc-repository for additional guidance on: \n• data security and \n• ITAR. \n6.7 Technical Assessment \nTechnical assessment is the crosscutting process used to help monitor technical progress of a \nprogram/project through periodic technical reviews and through monitoring of technical indicators such \nas MOEs, MOPs, Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), and TPMs. The reviews and metrics also provide \nstatus information to support assessing system design, product realization, and technical management \ndecisions. \n",

              "text": "4.0 System Design Processes  \nThis chapter describes the activities in the system design processes listed in FIGURE 2.1-1. The chapter is \nseparated into sections corresponding to processes 1 to 4 listed in FIGURE 2.1-1. The tasks within each \nprocess are discussed in terms of inputs, activities, and outputs. Additional guidance is provided using \nexamples that are relevant to NASA projects. \nThe system design processes are interdependent, highly iterative and recursive processes resulting in a \nvalidated set of requirements and a design solution that satisfies a set of stakeholder expectations. \nThere are four system design processes: developing stakeholder expectations, technical requirements, \nlogical decompositions, and design solutions.  \nFIGURE 4.0-1 illustrates the recursive relationship among the four system design processes. These \nprocesses start with a study team collecting and clarifying the stakeholder expectations, including the \nmission objectives, constraints, design drivers, operational objectives, and criteria for defining mission \nsuccess. This set of stakeholder expectations and high-level requirements is used to drive an iterative \ndesign loop where a straw man architecture/design, the concept of operations, and derived \nrequirements are developed. These three products should be consistent with each other and will require \niterations and design decisions to achieve this consistency. Once consistency is achieved, analyses allow \nthe project team to validate the proposed design against the stakeholder expectations. A simplified \nvalidation asks the questions: Will the system work as expected? Is the system achievable within budget \nand schedule constraints? Does the system provide the functionality and fulfill the operational needs \nthat drove the project’s funding approval? If the answer to any of these questions is no, then changes to \nthe design or stakeholder expectations will be required, and the process starts again. This process \ncontinues until the system—architecture, ConOps, and requirements—meets the stakeholder \nexpectations. \nThe depth of the design effort should be sufficient to allow analytical verification of the design to the \nrequirements. The design should be feasible and credible when judged by a knowledgeable independent \nreview team and should have sufficient depth to support cost modeling and operational assessment. \nOnce the system meets the stakeholder expectations, the study team baselines the products and \nprepares for the next phase. Often, intermediate levels of decomposition are validated as part of the \nprocess. In the next level of decomposition, the baselined derived (and allocated) requirements become \nthe set of high-level requirements for the decomposed elements and the process begins again. These \nsystem design processes are primarily applied in Pre-Phase A and continue through Phase C. \nThe system design processes during Pre-Phase A focus on producing a feasible design that will lead to \nFormulation approval. During Phase A, alternative designs and additional analytical maturity are \npursued to optimize the design architecture. Phase B results in a preliminary design that satisfies the \napproval criteria. During Phase C, detailed, build-to designs are completed. \nThis is a simplified description intended to demonstrate the recursive relationship among the system \ndesign processes. These processes should be used as guidance and tailored for each study team \ndepending on the size of the project and the hierarchical level of the study team. The next sections \ndescribe each of the four system design processes and their associated products for a given NASA \nmission. \n4.1 Stakeholder Expectations Definition \nThe Stakeholder Expectations Definition Process is the initial process within the SE engine that \nestablishes the foundation from which the system is designed and the product is realized. The main \npurpose of this process is to identify who the stakeholders are and how they intend to use the product. \nThis is usually accomplished through use-case scenarios (sometimes referred to as Design Reference \nMissions (DRMs)) and the ConOps. \n4.1.1 Process Description \nFIGURE 4.1-1 provides a typical flow diagram for the Stakeholder Expectations Definition Process and \nidentifies typical inputs, outputs, and activities to consider in defining stakeholder expectations. \n4.1.1.1 Inputs \nTypical inputs needed for the Stakeholder Expectations Definition Process include the following: \n• Initial Customer Expectations: These are the needs, goals, objectives, desires, capabilities, and other \nconstraints that are received from the customer for the product within the product layer. For the top-\ntier products (final end item), these are the expectations of the originating customer who requested the \nproduct. For an end product within the product layer, these are the expectations of the recipient of the \nend item when transitioned. \n• Other Stakeholder Expectations: These are the expectations of key stakeholders other than the \ncustomer. For example, such stakeholders may be the test team that will be receiving the transitioned \nproduct (end product and enabling products) or the trainers that will be instructing the operators or \nmanagers that are accountable for the product at this layer. \n• Customer Flow-down Requirements: These are any requirements that are being flowed down or \nallocated from a higher level (i.e., parent requirements). They are helpful in establishing the \nexpectations of the customer at this layer. \n4.1.1.2 Process Activities \n4.1.1.2.1 Identify Stakeholders \nA “stakeholder” is a group or individual that is affected by or has a stake in the product or project. The \nkey players for a project/product are called the key stakeholders. One key stakeholder is always the \n“customer.” The customer may vary depending on where the systems engineer is working in the PBS. \nFor example, at the topmost level, the customer may be the person or organization that is purchasing \nthe product. For a systems engineer working three or four levels down in the PBS, the customer may be \nthe leader of the team that takes the element and integrates it into a larger assembly. Regardless of \nwhere the systems engineer is working within the PBS, it is important to understand what is expected by \nthe customer.  \nOther interested parties are those who affect the project by providing broad, overarching constraints \nwithin which the customers’ needs should be achieved. These parties may be affected by the resulting \nproduct, the manner in which the product is used, or have a responsibility for providing life cycle \nsupport services. Examples include Congress, advisory planning teams, program managers, maintainers, \nand mission partners. It is important that the list of stakeholders be identified early in the process, as \nwell as the primary stakeholders who will have the most significant influence over the project. \nThe customer and users of the system are usually easy to identify. The other key stakeholders may be \nmore difficult to identify and they may change depending on the type of the project and the phase the \nproject is in. TABLE 4.1-1 provides some examples of stakeholders in the life cycle phase that should be \nconsidered. \n4.1.1.2.2 Understand Stakeholder Expectations \nThoroughly understanding the customer and other key stakeholders’ expectations for the \nproject/product is one of the most important steps in the systems engineering process. It provides the \nfoundation upon which all other systems engineering work depends. It helps ensure that all parties are \non the same page and that the product being provided will satisfy the customer. When the customer, \nother stakeholders, and the systems engineer mutually agree on the functions, characteristics, \nbehaviors, appearance, and performance the product will exhibit, it sets more realistic expectations on \nthe customer’s part and helps prevent significant requirements creep later in the life cycle. \nThrough interviews/discussions, surveys, marketing groups, e-mails, a Statement of Work (SOW), an \ninitial set of customer requirements, or some other means, stakeholders specify what is desired as an \nend state or as an item to be produced and put bounds on the achievement of the goals. These bounds \nmay encompass expenditures (resources), time to deliver, life cycle support expectations, performance \nobjectives, operational constraints, training goals, or other less obvious quantities such as organizational \nneeds or geopolitical goals. This information is reviewed, summarized, and documented so that all \nparties can come to an agreement on the expectations. \nFIGURE 4.1-2 shows the type of information needed when defining stakeholder expectations and depicts \nhow the information evolves into a set of high-level requirements. The yellow lines depict validation \npaths. Examples of the types of information that would be defined during each step are also provided. \nDefining stakeholder expectations begins with the mission authority and strategic objectives that the \nmission is meant to achieve. Mission authority changes depending on the category of the mission. For \nexample, science missions are usually driven by NASA Science Mission Directorate strategic plans, \nwhereas the exploration missions may be driven by a Presidential directive. Understanding the \nobjectives of the mission helps ensure that the project team is working toward a common vision. These \ngoals and objectives form the basis for developing the mission, so they need to be clearly defined and \narticulated. \nThe project team should also identify the constraints that may apply. A “constraint” is a condition that is \nto be met. Sometimes a constraint is dictated by external factors such as orbital mechanics, an existing \nsystem that must be utilized (external interface), a regulatory restriction, or the state of technology; \nsometimes constraints are the result of the overall budget environment. Concepts of operation and \nconstraints also need to be included in defining the stakeholder expectations. These identify how the \nsystem should be operated to achieve the mission objectives. \nNOTE: It is extremely important to involve stakeholders in all phases of a project. Such involvement \nshould be built in as a self-correcting feedback loop that will significantly enhance the chances of \nmission success. Involving stakeholders in a project builds confidence in the end product and serves as a \nvalidation and acceptance with the target audience.  \nIn identifying the full set of expectations, the systems engineer will need to interact with various \ncommunities, such as those working in the areas of orbital debris, space asset protection, human \nsystems integration, quality assurance, and reliability. Ensuring that a complete set of expectations is \ncaptured will help prevent “surprise” features from arising later in the life cycle. For example, space \nasset protection may require additional encryption for the forward link commands, additional shielding \nor filtering for RF systems, use of a different frequency, or other design changes that might be costly to \nadd to a system that has already been developed. \n4.1.1.2.3 Identify Needs, Goals, and Objectives \nIn order to define the goals and objectives, it is necessary to elicit the needs, wants, desires, capabilities, \nexternal interfaces, assumptions, and constraints from the stakeholders. Arriving at an agreed-to set of \ngoals and objectives can be a long and arduous task. Proactive iteration with the stakeholders \nthroughout the systems engineering process is the way that all parties can come to a true understanding \nof what should be done and what it takes to do the job. It is important to know who the primary \nstakeholders are and who has the decision authority to help resolve conflicts. \nNeeds, Goals, and Objectives (NGOs) provide a mechanism to ensure that everyone (implementer, \ncustomer, and other stakeholders) is in agreement at the beginning of a project in terms of defining the \nproblem that needs to be solved and its scope. NGOs are not contractual requirements or designs. \nNeeds are defined in the answer to the question “What problem are we trying to solve?” Goals address \nwhat must be done to meet the needs; i.e., what the customer wants the system to do. Objectives \nexpand on the goals and provide a means to document specific expectations. (Rationale should be \nprovided where needed to explain why the need, goal, or objective exists, any assumptions made, and \nany other information useful in understanding or managing the NGO.) \nWell-written NGOs provide clear traceability from the needs, then to the goals, and then to objectives. \nFor example, if a given goal does not support a need, or an objective does not support a goal, it should \nnot be part of the integrated set of NGOs. This traceability helps ensure that the team is actually \nproviding what is needed. \nThe following definitions (source: Applied Space Systems Engineering edited by Larson, Kirkpatrick, \nSellers, Thomas, and Verma) are provided to help the reader interpret the NGOs contained in this \nproduct. \n• Need: A single statement that drives everything else.

This helps \nestablish those areas where further trades will be made to narrow potential design solutions. \n• Identifying external and enabling systems with which the system should interact and establishing \nphysical and functional interfaces (e.g., mechanical, electrical, thermal, human, etc.). \n• Defining functional and behavioral expectations for the range of anticipated uses of the system as \nidentified in the ConOps. The ConOps describes how the system will be operated and the possible use-\ncase scenarios. \n4.2.1.2.2 Define Requirements \nA complete set of project requirements includes those that are decomposed and allocated down to \ndesign elements through the PBS and those that cut across product boundaries. Requirements allocated \nto the PBS can be functional requirements (what functions need to be performed), performance \nrequirements (how well these functions should be performed), and interface requirements (product to \nproduct interaction requirements). Crosscutting requirements include environmental, safety, human \nfactors, and those that originate from the “-ilities” and from Design and Construction (D&C) standards. \nFIGURE 4.2-2 is a general overview on the flow of requirements, what they are called, and who is \nresponsible (owns) for approving waivers. \n• Functional requirements define what functions need to be performed to accomplish the objectives. \n• Performance requirements define how well the system needs to perform the functions. \nWith an overall understanding of the constraints, physical/functional interfaces, and \nfunctional/behavioral expectations, the requirements can be further defined by establishing \nperformance and other technical criteria. The expected performance is expressed as a quantitative \nmeasure to indicate how well each product function needs to be accomplished.  \nNOTE: Requirements can be generated from non-obvious stakeholders and may not directly support the \ncurrent mission and its objectives, but instead provide an opportunity to gain additional benefits or \ninformation that can support the Agency or the Nation. Early in the process, the systems engineer can \nhelp identify potential areas where the system can be used to collect unique information that is not \ndirectly related to the primary mission. Often outside groups are not aware of the system goals and \ncapabilities until it is almost too late in the process. \nTechnical requirements come from a number of sources including functional, performance, interface, \nenvironmental, safety, human interfaces, standards and in support of the “’ilities” such as reliability, \nsustainability, producibility and others. Consideration and inclusion of all types of requirements is \nneeded in order to form a complete and consistent set of technical requirements from which the system \nwill be architected and designed. FIGURE 4.2-3 shows an example of parent and child requirement flow-\ndown. \n4.2.1.2.3 Define Requirements in Acceptable Statements \nFinally, the requirements should be defined in acceptable “shall” statements, which are complete \nsentences with a single “shall” per statement. Rationale for the requirement should also be captured to \nensure the reason and context of the requirement is understood. The Key Driving Requirements (KDRs) \nshould be identified. These are requirements that can have a large impact on cost or schedule when \nimplemented. A KDR can have any priority or criticality. Knowing the impact that a KDR has on the \ndesign allows better management of requirements. \nSee Appendix C for guidance and a checklist on how to write good requirements and Appendix E for \nvalidating requirements. A well-written requirements document provides several specific benefits to \nboth the stakeholders and the technical team as shown in TABLE 4.2-1. \nIt is useful to capture information about each of the requirements, called metadata, for future reference \nand use. Many requirements management tools will request or have options for storing this type of \ninformation. TABLE 4.2-2 provides examples of the types of metadata that might be useful. \n4.2.1.2.4 Validate Technical Requirements \nAn important part of requirements definition is the validation of the requirements against the \nstakeholder expectations, the mission objectives and constraints, the concept of operations, and the \nmission success criteria. Validating requirements can be broken into six steps: \n1. ",

The form of the product transitioned will be a function of the product life cycle \nphase success criteria and the location within the system structure of the WBS model in which the end \nproduct exists. The systems engineer involvement in this process includes ensuring the product being \ntransitioned has been properly tested and verified/validated prior to being shipped to the next level \nstakeholder/customer. \nProduct transition occurs during all phases of the life cycle. During the early phases, the technical team’s \nproducts are documents, models, studies, and reports. As the project moves through the life cycle, these \npaper or soft products are transformed through implementation and integration processes into \nhardware and software solutions to meet the stakeholder expectations. They are repeated with \ndifferent degrees of rigor throughout the life cycle. The Product Transition Process includes product \ntransitions from one level of the system architecture upward. The Product Transition Process is the last \nof the product realization processes, and it is a bridge from one level of the system to the next higher \nlevel. \nThe Product Transition Process is the key to bridge from one activity, subsystem, or element to the \noverall engineered system. As the system development nears completion, the Product Transition \nProcess is again applied for the end product, but with much more rigor since now the transition \nobjective is delivery of the system-level end product to the actual end user. Depending on the kind or \ncategory of system developed, this may involve a Center or the Agency and impact thousands of \nindividuals storing, handling, and transporting multiple end products; preparing user sites; training \noperators and maintenance personnel; and installing and sustaining, as applicable. Examples are \ntransitioning the external tank, solid rocket boosters, and orbiter to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for \nintegration and flight. Another example is the transition of a software subsystem for integration into a \ncombined hardware/software system. \n5.5.1 Process Description \nFIGURE 5.5-1 provides a typical flow diagram for the Product Transition Process and identifies typical \ninputs, outputs, and activities to consider in addressing product transition. \n5.5.1.1 Inputs \nInputs to the Product Transition Process depend primarily on the transition requirements, the product \nthat is being transitioned, the form of the product transition that is taking place, and the location to \nwhich the product is transitioning.

The decision as to which of these realization strategies or combination of strategies will be used \nfor the products of this project will have been made early in the life cycle using the Decision Analysis \nProcess. \n5.1.1 Process Description \nFIGURE 5.1-1 provides a typical flow diagram for the Product Implementation Process and identifies \ntypical inputs, outputs, and activities to consider in addressing product implementation. \n5.1.1.1 Inputs \nInputs to the Product Implementation Process depend primarily on the decision about whether the end \nproduct will be purchased, developed from scratch, or formed by reusing part or all of products from \nother projects. Typical inputs are shown in FIGURE 5.1-1. \n• Inputs If Purchasing the End Product: If the decision was made to purchase part or all of the products \nfor this project, the end product design specifications are obtained from the configuration management \nsystem as well as other applicable Documents.  \n• Inputs If Making/Coding the End Product: For end products that will be made/coded by the technical \nteam, the inputs will be the configuration- controlled design specifications, manufacturing plans, \nmanufacturing processes, manufacturing procedures, and raw materials as provided to or purchased by \nthe project. \n• Inputs Needed If Reusing an End Product: For end products that will reuse part or all of products \ngenerated by other projects, the inputs may be the documentation associated with the product as well \nas the product itself. Care should be taken to ensure that these products will indeed meet the \nspecifications and environments for this project. These would have been factors involved in the Decision \nAnalysis Process to determine the make/ buy/reuse decision. \n• Enabling Products: These would be any enabling products necessary to make, code, purchase, or reuse \nthe product (e.g., drilling fixtures, production facilities, production lines, software development facilities, \nsoftware test facilities, system integration and test facilities). \n5.1.1.2 Process Activities \nImplementing the product can take one of three forms: \n1. Purchase/buy \n2. ",
